🌐 **Michael Kennedy — Platform Engineer | Cloud, Hybrid, & Infrastructure Architect**

**I design, build, and automate full-stack platform infrastructure across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments.**
My work spans AWS, Kubernetes, VMware, Proxmox, networking, security, observability, and application delivery.

I build systems that **developers love, security trusts,** and **ops can run** — with IaC, CI/CD, strong governance, and clear platform boundaries.

🚀 What I Build (Flagship Repos)

These three repositories define my engineering identity.
They represent how I think, design, and ship platform infrastructure.

**1. platform-eks-nginx-kic**

**Production-ready EKS + NGINX Ingress + IRSA architecture.**

✔ Terraform (modular)
✔ NGINX Ingress Controller
✔ Secure workload boundaries
✔ Demo workloads + L7 routing
✔ CI for IaC & manifest validation

**→ A complete “cloud-native edge” stack.**

**2. vsphere-nginx-secure-appstack**

**Hybrid infrastructure: vSphere + cloud-init + NGINX secure application gateway.**

✔ VMware VM automation
✔ Secure NGINX reverse proxy layer
✔ TLS termination
✔ Application nodes via cloud-init
✔ Enterprise-style architecture & flows

**→ Shows how I build secure, governed on-prem platforms.**

**3. eks-policy-observability-stack**

**Governance + observability for real Kubernetes platforms.**

✔ Admission control
✔ Network policies
✔ Datadog / OpenTelemetry
✔ Alerts & telemetry pipelines
✔ Terraform + K8s policies

**→ Because real platforms need control, not just clusters.**

🧠 My Engineering Identity (Identity OS)

I operate with a clear personal engineering system:

**_Platform Thinking_**

I build infrastructure as products, not projects.
My focus is on developer usability, observability, paved roads, and golden paths.

**_Governed Freedom_**

Teams move fast when platforms give them autonomy within safe, secure guardrails.
I design those guardrails.

**_Automation at the Edges_**

Infra without automation is liability.
Everything I build is driven by IaC, cloud-init, pipelines, and declarative configs.

**_Clarity Over Cleverness_**

My identity OS prioritizes clarity, repeatability, and narrative over hacks and heroics.

**_Consistency > Complexity_**

Platforms survive by being consistent.
I create simple, stable patterns — even when solving complex multi-domain problems.

🏆 Certifications (Credly)

These aren’t badges; they’re signals of lifelong learning and broad capability across cloud, networks, infra, and security.

**Notable certifications include:**

- **AWS** – Cloud, Architecture, Security
- **Azure** – Administrator, Infrastructure, Identity
- **Kubernetes** – CKA/CKAD style workloads and platform fundamentals
- **Security & Networking** – F5, FireMon, Palo Alto, NGINX, Zero Trust
- **DevOps & Automation** – Terraform, CI/CD systems, automation frameworks

Certs reinforce what my repos prove:
**I think across layers — from metal → hypervisor → cloud → cluster → app → edge.**

🏗️ What I’m Currently Building

- Modernizing and polishing the extracted platform repos for public presentation
- Building an end-to-end identity map that aligns:
  - my personal engineering philosophy
  - my certified skill sets
  - my platform engineering work
  - my long-term direction (cloud + hybrid + security + developer experience)
- Designing a Platform Engineer Portfolio that demonstrates:
  - design decisions
  - architecture diagrams
  - IaC patterns
  - governance fundamentals
  - real-world infrastructure thinking

🔧 Technical Focus Areas

**Infrastructure:**
AWS, Azure, VMware, Proxmox, Bare Metal, Virtualization

**Kubernetes Platforms:**
EKS, Kubeadm, ingress/KIC, CNI models, cluster bootstrap, governance

**App Delivery & Networking:**
NGINX, F5 (BIG-IP, XC), Load Balancing, L4/L7 policy, service mesh integration

**Security:**
Zero Trust patterns, mTLS, hardened baselines, network policy, RBAC

**Observability:**
OpenTelemetry, Datadog, metrics/logs/traces, collectors, pipelines

**Automation:**
Terraform, Packer, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, cloud-init, Helm

⚙️ How I Work

- IaC first: everything is declarative
- Pipelines everywhere: every environment tested, validated, formatted
- Strong opinions, loosely held: I choose patterns deliberately
- Architecture visible: diagrams > assumptions
- Extremely practical: I build things I would want to support
